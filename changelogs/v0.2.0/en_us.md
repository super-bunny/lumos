<p class="img-caption">New brightness overlay!</p>

# Features

- **This brand-new popup** that will now inform you of new features and changes after each update!
  <p class="caption">After close, you can show it again from top right menu or settings.</p>

- **App will now auto update at launch on Windows and macOS.**
  <p class="caption">You can also apply pending update immediately thanks to a button showing in the app header.</p>

- **The new brightness overlay** allow you to see brightness changes on top of all applications (like for volume on most operating systems).
  <p class="caption">To enable it go to Interface settings. You will need to "bind" your screens to make it works.</p>

# Bug fixes

- Fixed the app asking two times the monitor list to the operating system at startup, often leading to missing monitors in
  the list.

- Fix bad behavior of app minimizing at startup.

# Miscellaneous

- Add a Material Dark theme (you can change theme from interface settings).

- Scrollbars in app are now styled based on current theme (actually there are almost the same for all themes).

- Global shortcuts and brightness changes have been rate limited to avoid evil humans to spam it making the app panic
  under that pressure.

- App can be restarted from the tray menu (who will use it? I don't know but it's here).

- Hide menu bar of app window.
